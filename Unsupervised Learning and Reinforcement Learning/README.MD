We have concluded that the solution provided for question 3 cannot be obtained. Instead, we provided a similar but working solution with a different set of logical steps.

The reason that the provided solution cannot be obtains is due to the fact that the final summation was expected to be linear scaling of every column of x summed together to get a vector, but transpose(X)*w will isntead take the dot product of the entire w vector with every training example which is not an equivalent representation.
