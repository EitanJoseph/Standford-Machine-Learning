# Coursework for CS229 Machine Learning
## Taught by Prof. Andrew Ng
### Caroline Wang - Eitan Joseph

This repository contains all the coursework for Prof. Andrew Ng's CS229 ML class seperated into folders for different problem sets.
Each problem set contains a Latex file with extension .tex and some other file for hands-on application such as MATLAB files (extension .m).

To use the MATLAB files you can simply import the entire project directory into MATLAB and run the code there.

To view the a .tex file just open it in some Latex interpreter. All .tex files were written in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
