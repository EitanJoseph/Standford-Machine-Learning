# Coursework for CS229 Machine Learning
## Caroline Wang - Eitan Joseph
### Taught by Prof. Andrew Ng

This repository contains all the coursework for Prof. Andrew Ng's CS229 ML class seperated into folders for different problem sets.
Each problem set contains a Latex file with extension _.tex_ and some other file for hands-on application such as MATLAB files (extension _.m_).

To use the MATLAB files you can simply import the entire project directory into MATLAB and run the code there.

To view the a _.tex_ file just open it in some Latex interpreter. All _.tex_ files were written in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

Note: We corrected many of the problem set solutions throughout the course - there are some incorrect solutions/typos in the actual coursework. You can find notes ont he corrections throughout the repository.
